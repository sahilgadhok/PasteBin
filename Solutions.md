## End-Users

In our app there are 2 main end-users to consider. 
- The first is the one that is using Filehub anonymously. This user is using Filehub not as a tool for personal file storage but as a way to share their files with other users of the site. Due to the fact that they can't access a profile to quickly view their uploaded files, this user is most likely going to use this a way to quickly share work with other users of the site. e.g. A useful code snippet

- The other end-user is the one that signs up for the website. This user is one that needs a quick and easy way to upload a file for use later, they also want share this upload with others to get reactions or feedback from other viewers of the file.
